# AU3318-Tapping-signal-analysis-and-processing

This is a rough product of the project in AU3318 course. 
The project asks you to separate a series of tapping signals and analysis in both time domain and grequency domain, the specific mission is in the following. 

Given different tightness of signals.
1. Separate the signal of each tap in the time domain (Select an appropriate and identical time domain signal length).
2. Transform the selected signal into **frequency domain**.
3. Compare and analyse the characteristics of different tightness signals.
4. Extract features and classify them using two different methods. I used a self-designed method and svm ML to classify them.
5. Obtain the relationship between tightness (pressure value) and frequency.
